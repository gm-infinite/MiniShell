** MINISHELL MAIN EXECUTION ENGINE AND PROGRAM ENTRY POINT
** ============================================================================
** 
** This file implements the core program entry point and main execution loop
** for the minishell interactive command interpreter. It orchestrates the
** fundamental shell lifecycle including initialization, input processing,
** command parsing, execution, and cleanup.
**
** PROGRAM ARCHITECTURE:
** ====================
** The minishell follows a classic Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) architecture:
**
** 1. INITIALIZATION PHASE:
**    - Shell structure initialization with default values
**    - Environment variable import and processing
**    - Signal handler configuration for interactive behavior
**    - History system initialization via GNU readline
**
** 2. INTERACTIVE LOOP PHASE:
**    - Continuous prompt display and user input collection
**    - Signal handling integration with readline for proper interruption
**    - Input validation including quote matching and syntax checking
**    - Command parsing, tokenization, and logical operator processing
**    - Command execution via dispatcher with proper error handling
**    - Exit status management for subsequent command reference ($?)
**
** 3. CLEANUP AND TERMINATION PHASE:
**    - Graceful resource deallocation for all dynamic structures
**    - History buffer cleanup and persistence
**    - Environment variable cleanup
**    - Process termination with appropriate exit code
**
** SIGNAL INTEGRATION:
** ==================
** The shell implements sophisticated signal handling that integrates with
** the GNU readline library for proper interactive behavior:
** - SIGINT (Ctrl+C): Interrupts current command, displays new prompt
** - SIGQUIT (Ctrl+\): Ignored in interactive mode, processed in children
** - Signal state preserved across readline calls for consistency
**
** ERROR HANDLING PHILOSOPHY:
** ==========================
** - Syntax errors (unclosed quotes, invalid operators) are caught early
** - Command execution errors are isolated and don't terminate the shell
** - Memory allocation failures are handled gracefully where possible
** - Signal interruptions are processed without state corruption
**
** MEMORY MANAGEMENT STRATEGY:
** ===========================
** - All dynamic allocations are tracked and properly deallocated
** - Input buffers are freed after each command cycle
** - Environment variables maintain reference semantics with proper cleanup
** - History management is delegated to GNU readline for reliability
**
** POSIX COMPLIANCE:
** ================
** - Exit status handling follows POSIX shell conventions
** - Signal behavior matches standard shell expectations
** - Environment variable handling maintains POSIX semantics
** - Command execution and error reporting follow standard conventions

** INTERACTIVE SHELL MAIN LOOP AND COMMAND PROCESSING ENGINE
** ============================================================================
*/

/**
 * @brief Initiates and manages the interactive shell main execution loop
 * 
 * This function implements the core Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) that forms
 * the heart of any interactive shell. It manages the complete lifecycle of
 * user interaction, from prompt display through command execution to result
 * presentation. The function integrates multiple complex subsystems including
 * readline input handling, signal processing, quote validation, command
 * parsing, and execution orchestration.
 * 
 * MAIN LOOP ARCHITECTURE:
 * ======================
 * The function implements a sophisticated event-driven loop that processes:
 * 
 * 1. SIGNAL SETUP AND INTEGRATION:
 *    - Configures signal handlers for interactive shell behavior
 *    - Integrates signal handling with GNU readline for proper interruption
 *    - Maintains signal state consistency across command executions
 * 
 * 2. INPUT COLLECTION AND PROCESSING:
 *    - Displays interactive prompt ("minishell > ") to user
 *    - Collects user input via GNU readline with history support
 *    - Handles EOF conditions (Ctrl+D) with graceful shell termination
 *    - Manages signal interruptions during input collection
 * 
 * 3. SIGNAL STATE MANAGEMENT:
 *    - Processes signals received during readline input collection
 *    - Updates exit status appropriately for signal interruptions
 *    - Resets signal flags to maintain clean state for next iteration
 * 
 * 4. INPUT VALIDATION AND SYNTAX CHECKING:
 *    - Validates input for completeness (checks for unclosed quotes)
 *    - Performs early syntax error detection before parsing
 *    - Reports syntax errors with appropriate error messages
 *    - Updates exit status to reflect syntax error conditions
 * 
 * 5. COMMAND PARSING AND TOKENIZATION:
 *    - Processes input through option/argument separation
 *    - Creates tokenized representation for parser consumption
 *    - Handles complex command structures including logical operators
 * 
 * 6. COMMAND EXECUTION AND ERROR HANDLING:
 *    - Dispatches parsed commands to appropriate execution handlers
 *    - Manages execution context and maintains shell state
 *    - Handles execution errors without terminating the shell
 * 
 * 7. RESOURCE CLEANUP AND MEMORY MANAGEMENT:
 *    - Frees input buffers after each command cycle
 *    - Cleans up tokenization structures
 *    - Maintains clean memory state across iterations
 * 
 * SIGNAL HANDLING INTEGRATION:
 * ============================
 * The function implements sophisticated signal handling that works correctly
 * with the GNU readline library:
 * 
 * - SIGINT Handling: When Ctrl+C is pressed during input, the global signal
 *   flag is set, readline is interrupted, and the shell displays a new prompt
 *   with appropriate exit status (130) reflecting the interruption.
 * 
 * - Signal State Management: The global signal flag is reset at the beginning
 *   of each loop iteration to ensure clean signal state processing.
 * 
 * - EOF Handling: When user presses Ctrl+D (EOF), readline returns NULL,
 *   triggering graceful shell termination via safe_exit().
 * 
 * QUOTE VALIDATION ALGORITHM:
 * ===========================
 * Before parsing any input, the function validates quote matching:
 * - Scans input for unmatched single quotes (')
 * - Scans input for unmatched double quotes (")
 * - Reports syntax errors for unclosed quotes
 * - Prevents parser from processing malformed input
 * 
 * COMMAND PROCESSING PIPELINE:
 * ============================
 * Valid input goes through a sophisticated processing pipeline:
 * 1. sep_opt_arg(): Separates options and arguments, handles quote preservation
 * 2. create_split_str(): Tokenizes input into structured representation
 * 3. parser_and_or(): Parses logical operators (&&, ||) and parentheses
 * 4. Command execution via appropriate dispatcher functions
 * 
 * ERROR RECOVERY STRATEGY:
 * =======================
 * The shell implements robust error recovery:
 * - Syntax errors don't terminate the shell - new prompt is displayed
 * - Execution errors are contained and don't affect shell stability
 * - Memory allocation failures are handled gracefully where possible
 * - Signal interruptions are processed without state corruption
 * 
 * TERMINATION CONDITIONS:
 * ======================
 * The main loop continues until one of these conditions:
 * - shell->should_exit flag is set (via exit command or internal logic)
 * - EOF is received from readline (Ctrl+D)
 * - Critical system error occurs
 * 
 * Upon termination, comprehensive cleanup is performed:
 * - Environment variables are deallocated
 * - Command history is cleared from memory
 * - Process exits with appropriate exit code
 * 
 * @param shell Pointer to main shell structure containing all state
 * 
 * @note This function contains the main execution loop and doesn't return
 * @note All dynamic memory is properly managed within the loop
 * @note Signal handling is integrated with readline for proper behavior

/**
 * @brief Initializes the main shell structure with safe default values
 * 
 * This function performs comprehensive initialization of the t_shell structure
 * to ensure all fields have safe, known values before any shell operations
 * begin. Proper initialization is critical for preventing undefined behavior
 * from uninitialized memory and ensuring consistent shell state.
 * 
 * INITIALIZATION PHILOSOPHY:
 * =========================
 * The function follows a defensive programming approach where every field
 * is explicitly initialized to a safe default value. This prevents issues
 * that could arise from random memory contents and ensures predictable
 * behavior across different systems and compilation environments.
 * 
 * FIELD-BY-FIELD INITIALIZATION:
 * ==============================
 * 
 * 1. INPUT MANAGEMENT:
 *    - current_input: NULL (no input currently being processed)
 *    - split_input: Empty split structure (no tokens)
 * 
 * 2. EXECUTION STATE:
 *    - past_exit_status: 0 (success, used for $? expansion)
 *    - should_exit: 0 (shell should continue running)
 *    - exit_code: 0 (successful termination when shell exits)
 * 
 * 3. PROCESS MANAGEMENT:
 *    - child_pids: NULL (no child processes tracked initially)
 *    - parent_or_child: 'p' (this process is the parent shell)
 *    - pipe_count: 0 (no pipes in current command)
 * 
 * 4. ENVIRONMENT:
 *    - envp: NULL (environment will be imported during startup)
 * 
 * MEMORY SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS:
 * ============================
 * - All pointer fields are initialized to NULL to prevent accidental
 *   dereferencing of garbage addresses
 * - Numeric fields are initialized to sensible defaults
 * - The split_input structure is properly initialized using create_split()
 *   with NULL data and zero size
 * 
 * EXTENSIBILITY DESIGN:
 * ====================
 * The comment emphasizes that if the t_shell structure grows with additional
 * fields, they should be initialized here to maintain consistency and prevent
 * bugs from uninitialized values. This serves as documentation for future
 * maintenance and development.
 * 
 * INTEGRATION WITH STARTUP SEQUENCE:
 * =================================
 * This function is called early in main() before any other shell operations:
 * 1. shell_init() - Initialize structure with defaults
 * 2. init_environment() - Import and process environment variables
 * 3. start_shell() - Begin interactive command processing
 * 
 * @param shell Pointer to shell structure to initialize
 * 
 * @note All fields must be explicitly initialized to prevent undefined behavior
 * @note New fields added to t_shell should be initialized here
 * @note This function should be called before any other shell operations

/**
 * @brief Main program entry point and shell initialization orchestrator
 * 
 * This function serves as the primary entry point for the minishell program
 * and orchestrates the complete shell initialization sequence. It handles
 * the integration with the operating system, processes command-line arguments,
 * and sets up the execution environment before transferring control to the
 * interactive shell loop.
 * 
 * STARTUP SEQUENCE OVERVIEW:
 * =========================
 * The function implements a carefully ordered startup sequence:
 * 
 * 1. ARGUMENT PROCESSING:
 *    - Acknowledges but ignores command-line arguments
 *    - Minishell operates as an interactive shell, not a script interpreter
 *    - Future extensions could process arguments for batch mode or options
 * 
 * 2. SHELL STRUCTURE INITIALIZATION:
 *    - Calls shell_init() to establish safe default values
 *    - Ensures all structure fields have known, safe initial states
 *    - Prevents undefined behavior from uninitialized memory
 * 
 * 3. ENVIRONMENT INTEGRATION:
 *    - Imports system environment variables via init_environment()
 *    - Processes PATH, HOME, USER, and other standard variables
 *    - Establishes environment for child process inheritance
 * 
 * 4. INTERACTIVE LOOP ACTIVATION:
 *    - Transfers control to start_shell() for command processing
 *    - Note: start_shell() never returns - it contains the main loop
 *    - Shell termination occurs within start_shell() via exit() calls
 * 
 * ARGUMENT HANDLING PHILOSOPHY:
 * ============================
 * Currently, the shell ignores command-line arguments (argc, argv) as it
 * operates purely in interactive mode. The (void) casts explicitly acknowledge
 * these parameters to prevent compiler warnings while indicating intentional
 * non-use. Future enhancements might include:
 * - Script file execution: minishell script.sh
 * - Command execution: minishell -c "command"
 * - Option processing: minishell --version, --help
 * 
 * ENVIRONMENT INHERITANCE:
 * =======================
 * The shell inherits the complete environment from its parent process via
 * the envp parameter. This environment is processed and stored in the shell
 * structure for:
 * - Variable expansion in commands ($HOME, $PATH, etc.)
 * - Environment inheritance to child processes
 * - Built-in command processing (export, unset, env)
 * 
 * CONTROL FLOW AND TERMINATION:
 * =============================
 * This function represents the beginning of shell execution but not the end.
 * Control flow proceeds as follows:
 * 1. main() performs initialization
 * 2. start_shell() takes over with the interactive loop
 * 3. Shell termination occurs within start_shell() via exit() calls
 * 4. main() never reaches its return statement under normal operation
 * 
 * SYSTEM INTEGRATION NOTES:
 * =========================
 * - Process inherits file descriptors from parent (usually terminal)
 * - Environment variables are imported from system environment
 * - Signal handling is configured for interactive terminal behavior
 * - Working directory is inherited from parent process
 * 
 * @param argc Argument count (currently unused, reserved for future features)
 * @param argv Argument vector (currently unused, reserved for future features)
 * @param envp Environment variable array inherited from parent process
 * @return int Exit status (note: function typically doesn't return)
 * 
 * @note Function doesn't return under normal operation due to start_shell()
 * @note Environment is inherited and processed for shell and child processes
 * @note Command-line arguments are currently ignored but acknowledged
