# Minishell Implementation - COMPLETED

## Overview
This is a robust, feature-complete minishell implementation in C that replicates bash behavior with strict memory management and comprehensive functionality.

## Features Implemented

### Core Features ✅
- **Interactive shell prompt** with proper readline integration
- **Command execution** with PATH resolution
- **Exit status handling** with proper propagation
- **Environment variable expansion** ($VAR syntax)
- **Memory management** - Zero memory leaks confirmed by valgrind

### Built-in Commands ✅
- `echo` with -n option support
- `cd` with relative and absolute paths
- `pwd` for current directory
- `export` for environment variables
- `unset` for removing variables
- `env` for listing environment
- `exit` with proper cleanup

### Advanced Features ✅
- **Quotes handling** (single and double quotes)
- **Input/Output redirections**: `<`, `>`, `>>`, `<<` (here documents)
- **Error redirection**: `2>` for stderr
- **Pipes** for command chaining
- **Logical operators**: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR)
- **Parentheses** for priority and grouping
- **Signal handling** (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D, Ctrl+\)

### Parsing and Execution ✅
- **Robust tokenization** with quote-aware splitting
- **Parentheses parser** with proper nesting support
- **Priority handling** for logical operators
- **Complex command combinations** support

## Memory Management ✅
- **Zero memory leaks** confirmed by comprehensive valgrind testing
- **Proper cleanup** on exit and error conditions
- **Environment management** with allocation tracking
- **Signal-safe operations** without memory corruption

## Testing Status ✅
- **All core functionality tested** and working
- **Edge cases handled** including malformed input
- **Stress testing passed** with complex nested commands
- **Memory leak testing passed** with valgrind
- **Signal handling verified** for robustness

## Recent Improvements
1. **Fixed parentheses parser** - resolved out-of-bounds access and operator comparison
2. **Added stderr redirection** - full support for `2>` syntax including spaced tokens
3. **Enhanced error handling** - better detection of malformed parentheses
4. **Memory leak fixes** - all user code leaks eliminated
5. **Comprehensive testing** - extensive test suites for all features

## Example Commands That Work
```bash
# Basic commands
echo hello world
ls -la | grep test

# Logical operators
echo start && echo success || echo failure
(echo first && echo second) || echo third

# Redirections
ls > output.txt
ls /nonexistent 2> error.log
cat < input.txt

# Complex combinations
(export VAR=test && echo $VAR) && (pwd | cat) || echo failed
((echo nested) && echo works) && echo perfectly

# Here documents
cat << EOF
This is a here document
EOF
```

## Code Quality
- **Norminette compliant** C code
- **Well-structured** with modular design
- **Comprehensive error handling**
- **Memory-safe** operations throughout
- **Signal-safe** implementations

## Performance
- **Efficient parsing** with minimal overhead
- **Optimized memory usage** with proper cleanup
- **Fast execution** for typical shell operations
- **Robust under stress** with complex nested operations

This minishell implementation successfully replicates bash behavior while maintaining strict memory management and providing all required functionality including advanced features like parentheses grouping and comprehensive redirection support.
